''' 

a program is set of instructions which performs operations on data. When a program is dealing with data, then the way the data is organised in the memory is called "DATA STRUCTURES" OR the way you organise data in main memory during execution of program is called "DATA STRUCTURES"

Depending on requirements, we may choose data structures. Data structures in C++ are:
- arrays
- matrices
- linked list
- stack
- queue
- trees
- graphs
- hashing
- recursion
- sorting

Here, 

Arrays, matrices and linked list are physical data structures which define how data is arranged in the memory.

Stack, queue, trees, graphs and hashing are logical data structures which define how data is utilised in the memory.
